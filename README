# CollageRecipe

Simplified collage making:

To make a collage:
1. Add your photos in a subfolder such as selected/
2. Create a file spec.files that has the format
   
   file11.jpg
   file12.jpg
   file13.jpg
   file14.jpg

   file21.jpg
   file22.jpg
   file23.jpg

Thene file11 will be the first photo on line 1, file23 will be the third photo on line 2, etc.
You can use any image that will be displayed in a <img> HTML tag. Use newline to separate photo lines.

3. Run genson.py - this will create the json file that the webpage can understand.
4. Open a browser and point it to localhost:8000 - there you will see the rendering, and you can choose to adjust it by rearranging the photos.
5. Run .... something with wk2pdf to create the standalone PDF.
